Earlier this year, I received a job offer from famous azerbaijani rap artists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xpert" target="_blank">Xpert</a> and <a href="https://az.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okaber" target="_blank">Okaber</a>. I was asked to prepare a music video for the "Universe" track that they made together years later. This creative track needed a music video like itself. Xpert, Okaber and me combined all our creativity and came up with this product.
